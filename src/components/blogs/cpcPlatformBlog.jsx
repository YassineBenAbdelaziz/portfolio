        <p>
            This project is a competitive programming platform that allows users to practice coding problems and participate in contests. The platform supports multiple programming languages and provides a real-time code editor for users to write and test their solutions. Users can also view their submission history, track their progress, and compare their performance with other users. The platform is built using React for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end, with a PostgreSQL database to store user data and problem information.
